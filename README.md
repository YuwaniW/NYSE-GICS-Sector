# NYSE-GICS-Sector
Analyzed real life data from the New York Stock Exchange by using Excel

The Excel project focuses on analyzing the costs incurred by companies in the Industrial and IT sectors of the NYSE using a dataset sourced from the GICS Sector classification. The primary objective is to compare and determine which sector bears higher costs. This involves applying data exploration, modeling, and statistical analysis techniques to gain insights from the financial statements of the listed companies.

To begin the project, the dataset is imported into Excel, followed by thorough data exploration and cleaning processes. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data for subsequent analysis. The next step involves developing financial models, which may include calculating various metrics such as gross profit margin, operating profit margin, and net profit margin. These models aid in assessing the financial performance of companies in the Industrial and IT sectors.

Furthermore, the project incorporates statistical analysis techniques to deepen the understanding of the relationship between costs and sector classification. Hypothesis tests and regression analysis are conducted to determine the significance and strength of this relationship. Such analyses provide valuable insights into the factors influencing costs within each sector and the overall financial performance.

By drawing conclusions from the project, meaningful insights regarding the relative cost burdens of the Industrial and IT sectors can be obtained. These findings can guide investment decisions and assist managers in identifying opportunities to reduce costs and enhance financial performance within their respective sectors.
