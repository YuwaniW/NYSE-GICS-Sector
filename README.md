# NYSE-GICS-Sector
Analyzed real life data from the New York Stock Exchange by using Excel
The Excel project focuses on analyzing the revenue incurred by companies in the Industrial and Energy sectors of the NYSE using a dataset sourced from the GICS Sector classification. The primary objective of the analysis is to compare and contrast the revenue characteristics of companies in the Energy and Industrials sectors. The focus is on identifying and interpreting key statistics, such as range, standard deviation, mean, median, and quartiles, to understand the variability, central tendency, and spread of revenue data within each sector. The analysis aims to provide insights into the revenue patterns and potential differences between the two sectors, which can be useful for investors, analysts, and researchers studying these industries.

To begin the project, the dataset is imported into Excel, followed by thorough data exploration and cleaning processes. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data for subsequent analysis. The next step involves developing financial models, which may include calculating various metrics such as gross profit margin, operating profit margin, and net profit margin. These models aid in assessing the financial performance of companies in each sectors.

These findings can inform investment decisions, benchmarking efforts, and further exploration of the underlying factors contributing to the revenue dynamics in each sector.
